# Hair Day - Haircut Scheduling App

Hair Day is a project developed as a hands-on exercise during Rocketseat’s training. 
It is a simple app for scheduling haircut appointments at a fictional salon. The project features functionalities such as booking, canceling, and viewing appointments, with key restrictions like preventing double bookings and disallowing appointments in the past. 
These restrictions were efficiently implemented using the Day.js library for date management.

The backend API was built with JSON Server, so while it can't be hosted directly, you can easily run it locally by following the instructions in this repository. Feel free to check out the project and give it a try! ✂️💻
